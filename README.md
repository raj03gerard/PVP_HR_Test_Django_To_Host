# PVP Project Documentation-

### The project has been made with **Python**, using the ** Django** framework. 
### It uses **Python**, along with** HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend, and **SQLite** database to store the data.

# TLDR: 

Category class- Creates categories like SCIENCE, HUMANITIES, ARTS etc. 

Each category has a passing mark, and students in a category must get a total of this passing mark or more in 2 subjects of that category.

By default it has 2 categories - SCIENCE and HUMANITIES

Subject class-  Creates subjects that each belong to a category. 
By default it has 5 subjects-  Maths, Biology, Japanese, English, History


Student class-  Creates students that each belong to a category. 

TestConditions class-  Creates test_condition that evaluates if a student passes or fails

Evaluation_Strategy class-  Creates evaluation_strategy that creates logic for determining if a student passes or fails.







Project Directory structure-

PVP_students_test_app, which contains all the relevant Python files for this project.
templates directory- contains the HTML files
Static directory- contains all the CSS/ JS files

Modules/ Classes

urls.py- Contains routing information for the different urls, that handle creation of students, subjects, categories, test_conditions etc

views.py - The starting point for the execution of the app, which contains the method to handle the route to the home page( index() ). 

-The index() function handles creating and sending the context data to the HTML   frontend.

-The default_data_check() function checks whether the app has some default data in it     as soon as the home page loads

-The get_default_colors() function gets the default color schemes for the app

Views_container- 

Contains the other views files that handle the functionalities such as student creation, subject creation, category creation, test_condition etc

category_views.py- Handles creation of new categories

student_views.py- Handles creation of new students

subject_views.py- Handles creation of new subjects

test_condition_views.py- Handles updation of test conditions
models.py-  This file contains the classes for Student, Subject, Category and Test_Conditions. All of these classes inherit from the Django models.Model class, which allows them to be created as individual tables in the database,


forms.py- This file creates individual forms from the Student, Subject and Category models, which in turn makes it very easy to handle inputs for each of these classes to create data in the database. 

apps.py- configures the app to run
admin.py- registers the different models to the Django admin console


evaluations-

Evaluate_Results- This class handles evaluation of each studentâ€™s result.

evaluation_strategies.py- 
-Evaluation_Strategy- This is an abstract class that contains the definition for the evaluate     method. New evaluation strategies are created from this class
-Evaluate_By_Total_Score- This class inherits the Evaluation_Strategy class, to evaluate the student result based on total_score
-Evaluate_By_Marks_In_Category- This class also inherits the Evaluation_Strategy class, to evaluate the student result marks in his category

data_state_handle-

default_data_creation.py- contains functions to create the default data for the app

default_data- contains some default data like enums for Student_Evaluation_Results, colors for the different categories( Default_Category_Colors) , etc


Migrations- 

Contains django generated files created during data migration
